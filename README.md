# A-Star-Search-Algorithm
This is my java implantation of A star search algorithm for path finding used in data structures class <br />
I am using simple text files to store the actual and heuristic distances from each city to every other city.  the charter “-”  in the input files indicates that there is no possible path to that city. All the data about each city is stored in a matrix and processed by the program.
# Notes:
* Start the program from the UI.java class<br />
* Use either “heuristic distances.txt” or “Actual Distances.txt” to import data to the matrix when prompt<br />
When prompt to select heuristic distances and Actual Distances input files hold CTRL key and select both files at the same time<br/>
The program will create an output file with the solution the path will be displayed in the console after execution is done <br />
